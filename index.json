[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a Graphics Hardware Engineer in the Image Processing Unit at Intel India. At present, I am working on a new algorithm for the placement of memories in design based on connectivity with ports, other memories, and standard cell logic in the design.\nOn the side of fun, I like to cook food for friends. I also like to write poems from time to time. You can read some of these here. On weekends, I can be found in a quiet corner at some literary event in Bangalore.\nI graduated from IIT Roorkee in 2018, where I was advised by Dr. Anand Bulusu. During my time at IIT Roorkee, I have also had the pleasure to work with Dr. Sanjeev Manhas. For my hobby projects, I got to work on some interesting stuff at the Artificial Intelligence \u0026amp; Electronics Section, IEEE Student Branch, and Mobile Development Group at IIT Roorkee.\nOver my bachelor’s, I have had the opportunity to explore many fields, ranging from Analog circuits, CMOS Devices to delay modeling in digital circuits. I also got to work on Industry research problems during my Internship at STMicroelectronics with Mr. Pratap Narayan Singh and during my major thesis at IIT Roorkee.\nI like interacting with my juniors. I had the opportunity of serving as a Teaching Assistant for the course ‘Semiconductor Devices’ twice and a mentor in the Institute’s Student mentorship program for freshmen undergrads.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1573305028,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Graphics Hardware Engineer in the Image Processing Unit at Intel India.
