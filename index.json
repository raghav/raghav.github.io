Ever so often, I also like to write poems at YourQuote. On weekends, I can be found in a quiet corner at some literary event in Bangalore.\nI graduated from IIT Roorkee in 2018, where I was advised by Dr. Anand Bulusu. During my time at IIT Roorkee, I also had the pleasure to work with Dr. Sanjeev Manhas. For my hobby projects, I worked on some interesting stuff at the Artificial Intelligence \u0026amp; Electronics Section, IEEE Student Branch, and Mobile Development Group at IIT Roorkee.\nOver my bachelor’s, I had the opportunity to explore many fields, ranging from Analog circuits, CMOS Devices to delay modeling in digital circuits. I also got to work on Industry research problems during my Internship at STMicroelectronics with Mr. Pratap Narayan Singh and during my major thesis at IIT Roorkee.\nI like interacting with my juniors. I did serve as a Teaching Assistant for the course ‘Semiconductor Devices’ twice and a mentor in the Institute’s Student mentorship program for freshmen undergrads.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1573483345,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Graphics Hardware Engineer in the Image Processing Unit at Intel India, working on Physical design optimization from synthesis to ECOs.

My colleagues share my enthusiasm and are always there to help me with my ideas. Working till late in the evening and brainstorming sessions are the best parts of the day.\nBeing my first company, Intel has helped me to get the gist of what is actually done in various teams across the Industry, a perspective far from what I (we) had (have) in college about the Industry. While this may not be the best place to be if you want to do Academic/ Industrial research, Intel taught me a lot about how the Industry works and how various teams collaborate.\nGoing on team outings is definitely one of the major events we look up to. Sharing the common love for food, we have been to almost every buffet in Bangalore during team lunches every fortnight. The recent potluck lunches have certainly played their part in bringing us together as a team.\nAll in all, at Intel, I find a culture conducive for growth and learning. Whether I wish to work from home or leave the office early, there are no questions asked as long as I do justice with the work. My mentors have always encouraged me to think of new ideas and work on them. The schedule becomes hectic sporadically, but we have always worked as a team in meeting deadlines.\n","date":1561852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573483345,"objectID":"5f9bb0795400cf1494dc0f5fd42c96b4","permalink":"/post/year-at-intel/","publishdate":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/year-at-intel/","section":"post","summary":"I joined Intel in June 2018 and it feels just like yesterday.
